# Node.js-Chat-App
 Chat App using Node.js, Express and Socket.io 
 After doing an npm install enter the following npm run command:
This will start the app and set it up to listen for incoming connections on port 5050. Open up your browser of choice and go to the url http://localhost:5050 to start using the app itself. The npm run dev command automatically runs the app using the nodemon script so any changes you make to the app's javascript, CSS or HTML code will automatically restart it.
